# Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL & Tableau  

📊 This project analyzes **customer engagement, purchases, and learning behavior** using **SQL** for data exploration and **Tableau** for visualization. It demonstrates how to structure queries, build reusable views, and generate actionable business insights.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Understand customer behavior across countries.  
- Analyze learning engagement (minutes watched, onboarding, paid vs. free usage).  
- Evaluate course performance (ratings, minutes watched).  
- Track purchase patterns and subscription cycles.  
- Visualize findings in Tableau and communicate insights through a presentation.

## 🛠️ SQL Highlights  
Some of the key SQL components in this project:  

- **CTEs for modular analysis**  
  - `ratings`: counts and averages course ratings.  
  - `minutes`: total and average watch time per course.  

- **Reusable Views**  
  - `purchases_info`: calculates subscription start/end dates based on type (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly).  
  - `full_student_info`: merges student info, purchases, and daily learning activity, with onboarding and paid indicators.  

- **Analytical Queries**  
  - Top 5 countries by purchases.  
  - Top 5 countries by total watch time.  
  - Top purchase months by student count.

## 📈 Tableau Visualization  
The Tableau dashboard builds on the SQL queries to provide:  
- Student information overview.  
- Monthly purchase seasonality.  
- Course performance analysis.  
- Actionable insights for marketing, pricing, and course strategy.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Purchases are concentrated in English-speaking countries → consider **translation/localization** to expand.  
- India and Nigeria show **high engagement but low conversions** → potential for **regional pricing**.  
- Odd months outperform even months due to campaign timing → marketing is effective, but could be smoothed out.  
- Introductory courses dominate → opportunity for **structured progression paths** to increase lifetime value.
